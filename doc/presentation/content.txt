Goal:

To help students on the process of learning functional programming with an
interactive application based on a tangible block world boosted by augmented
reality and software feedback.

tags: functional programming, block world, AR, software feedback

------------------------------------------

Issues:

* Conceptual: by focusing on students to overcome the main difficulty when
learning functional programming (data is not explicit).

* Technical: by developing a multi-platform open source software application
using unstable libraries.

* Interactive: by implementing the best fit software feedback.

* Practical: by testing the application on real programming students to analyse
the effectiveness of the method.

------------------------------------------

Proposed solution:

Development phase:

* Open source (GPL)
* CPP
* OSGArt

Test phase:

* Test design
* System deployment
* Measure Transfer-of-Training (Erlang)

------------------------------------------

Future work

* Finish the base development (ASAP)
* Choose the tests problems wisely
* Run the tests on the subjects
* Write paper and thesis
* Graduate
