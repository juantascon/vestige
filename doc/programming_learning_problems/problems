recursion problems:

what is the stop condition?
how to call the function itself?

different types of problems and their posible solutions, we plan to represent this kind of problems
and make sure the student understands it

types:

structural (reverse, append, last, etc)
structural + equality (remove_first, duplicate, etc)
structural + ordering (insertion_sort)
structural + nesting (pack, flatten)
structural + arithmetic (factorial, product, length, split, etc)

the first problem to design will be the reverse function
