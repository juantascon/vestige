\begin{abstract}
We aim at creating a system capable of helping students in the process
of learning how to program using the \Erlang functional programming
language. More precisely, the main goal is to teach the students how
to abstract an algorithm from a series of examples and then how to
write it as an \Erlang program. It is part of this research that some
human\hyp{}computer interface is used by the student to control the
system and receive feedback from it.
