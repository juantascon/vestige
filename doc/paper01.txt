Goal:
-----------------
The main goal of our research is to develop a system that helps students
to learn how to program using functional programming languages.

-----------------
Issues:
-----------------
Two different types of issues are detected:
* Technicals, by try to get to work unstable programming libraries.
* Interaction, by creating a practical and suitable user interface, that truly
helps students on learning.

-----------------
Approaches:

My Contribution:
-----------------
There are two main contributions:
* The use of augmented reality on a didactic system.
* The use of a block abstraction as basic tools to represent functional
programming algorithms.
