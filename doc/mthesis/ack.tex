\section*{Acknowledgements}

It is a pleasure to thank those who made this thesis possible. First,
my parents, Diego Tascón and Raquel Vidarte and my little brother,
Jose David Tascón for their unconditional love and support regardless
of the distance. Then, I would like to thank my professors,
Jee\hyp{}In Kim for his kindness and wise guidance, Christian
Rinderknecht for providing me with most of the bibliography and for
his friendship and constant help and also HyungSeok Kim for his
several collaborations. Finally, I am indebted to all my fellow
laboratory members for welcoming me into their group and into their
lives and to all my new friends in South Korea who made my life here
remarkably pleasant.
