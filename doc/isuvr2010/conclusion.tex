\section{Conclusion}

We explored a tangible interactive tool that will be used to help
beginners to learn how to recursively solve simple problems on stacks
of blocks and then how to transfer their training to the writing of
the corresponding \erlang functions.

Many technical efforts have been spent in order have the application
run on \textsf{GNU/Linux} and be licensed as open source, so the
interested researchers may benefit from the freedom to study it, use
it, modify it and redistribute it under the same terms.
