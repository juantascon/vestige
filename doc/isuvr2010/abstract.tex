Recursion is a powerful programming technique which is notoriously
difficult to master, especially in functional languages because they
prominently feature structural recursion as the main control\hyp{}flow
mechanism. We propose several hypotheses to understand the issue and
put some to the test by designing an open\hyp{}source interactive
interface based on a tangible block\hyp{}world with augmented reality
and software feedback. Stacks of blocks are used as an analogy for the
list data structure, which enables the simplest form of structural
recursion. After using this application, students are expected to
transfer their training to directly write recursive programs in
sequential \erlang, a purely functional language.
